**Orlando Love** is a single-page website built with **HTML** and **CSS**, dedicated to showcasing the charm and beauty of **Orlando, Florida** — my hometown for the past 32 years.   This project highlights Orlando’s most iconic attractions, its vibrant city life, and my personal connection to the place I call home.
